# How to use the scripts

## Load the packages and source code
Open RStudio. Make sure that your working directory is located where the scripts are saved.
```R
require('flowFDA')
require("vegan")
require("MESS")
```
The source code MRM.parameters.R contains all the necessary functions.
```R
source("MRM.parameters.R")
```
Set a fixed seed to ensure reproducible analysis
```R
set.seed(777)
```
## Data analysis (to run the following code in batch: fingerprint.R script)
Insert the path to your data folder, for example test_data for the tutorial data.
```R
path = "test_data"
flowData <- read.flowSet(path = path, transformation = FALSE, pattern=".fcs")
```
<p align="justify">At this point we select the phenotypic features of interest and transform their intensity values according to the hyperbolic arcsin. In this case we chose two fluorescent parameters and two scatter parameters in their height format (-H). Depending on the FCM, the resolution may increase by using the area values (-A) since many detectors have a higher signal resolution for area values. For transparency we store the transformed data in a new object, called <code>flowData_transformed</code>. Due to filtering of relevant parameters, we also reduce the data size of the <code>flowSet</code>. This becomes relevant for larger datasets. For example, a dataset of 200 samples of an average of 25 000 cells will require 200 - 300 MB of RAM.</p>

```R
flowData_transformed <- transform(flowData,`FL1-H`=asinh(`FL1-H`), 
                                   `SSC-H`=asinh(`SSC-H`), 
                                   `FL3-H`=asinh(`FL3-H`), 
                                   `FSC-H`=asinh(`FSC-H`))
param=c("FL1-H", "FL3-H","SSC-H","FSC-H")
flowData_transformed = flowData_transformed[,param]
remove(flowData)
```
<p align="justify">Now that the data has been formatted, we need to discard all the signals detected by the FCM which correspond to instrument noise and (in)organic background. This is done by selecting the cells in a scatterplot on the primary fluorescence or scatter signals. For SYBR Green I, this is done based on the <code>FL1-H</code> and <code>FL3-H</code> parameters. For this example, an initial polygon gate (<code>polyGate1</code>) is created and adjusted based on the sample type in question. For each specific experiment, it is advised to use identical gating for each sample. The gating strategy is evaluated on the <code>xyplot</code> and adjusted if necessary. A more detailed guideline for gating or denoising aquatic microbial samples can be found <a href="http://jornades.uab.cat/workshopmrama/sites/jornades.uab.cat.workshopmrama/files/Assessing_water_quality_with_the_BD_Accuri_C6_flow_cytometer.pdf">here</a> (p.6):</p>
```R
### Create a PolygonGate for denoising the dataset
### Define coordinates for gate in sqrcut1 in format: c(x,x,x,x,y,y,y,y)
sqrcut1 <- matrix(c(8.75,8.75,14,14,3,7.5,14,3),ncol=2, nrow=4)
colnames(sqrcut1) <- c("FL1-H","FL3-H")
polyGate1 <- polygonGate(.gate=sqrcut1, filterId = "Total Cells")

###  Gating quality check
xyplot(`FL3-H` ~ `FL1-H`, data=flowData_transformed[1], filter=polyGate1,
       scales=list(y=list(limits=c(0,14)),
                   x=list(limits=c(6,16))),
       axis = axis.default, nbin=125, 
       par.strip.text=list(col="white", font=2, cex=2), smooth=FALSE)
```
Here is an example of a good and bad filtering approach:
![My image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19682548/16420078/44b0d5ec-3d50-11e6-800d-10a1e3413ca2.png)
When the optimal gate has been chosen, the data can be denoised using the `Subset` function.  

```R
### Isolate only the cellular information based on the polyGate1
flowData_transformed <- Subset(flowData_transformed, polyGate1)
```
<p align="justify">Next, the phenotypic intensity values of each cell are normalized to the [0,1] range. This is required for using a bandwidth of 0.01 in the fingerprint calculation. Each parameter is normalized based on the maximum FL1-H intensity value over the data set.</p>

```R
summary <- fsApply(x=flowData_transformed,FUN=function(x) apply(x,2,max),use.exprs=TRUE)
max = max(summary[,1])
mytrans <- function(x) x/max
flowData_transformed <- transform(flowData_transformed,`FL1-H`=mytrans(`FL1-H`),
                                  `FL3-H`=mytrans(`FL3-H`), 
                                  `SSC-H`=mytrans(`SSC-H`),
                                  `FSC-H`=mytrans(`FSC-H`))
```

<p align="justify">The denoised data can now be used for calculating the phenotypic fingerprint using the <code>flowBasis</code> function. Changing <code>nbin</code> increases the grid resolution of the density estimation but also steeply increases the computation time. The most determining factor for getting an accurate kernel density estimation is the number of cells counted in <code>polyGate1</code>. In general, 1,000 cells will give a good estimation of the mean alpha-diversity (D<sub>2</sub>) but in order to reduce the variance on this estimate I would recommend a cell count of 10,000 cells or more. 

If desired, you can randomly resample your samples to the lowest sample size or any user specified sample size using the <code>FCS.resample()</code> function (standard without replacement, but can adjust by changing <code>replace</code>). Samples with a sample size that is equal to 0 or that is lower than the specified size will be discarded. </p>
```R
### Randomly resample to the lowest sample size
flowData_transformed <- FCS.resample(flowData_transformed, replace=FALSE)
### Calculate fingerprint with bw = 0.01
fbasis <- flowBasis(flowData_transformed, param, nbin=128, 
                   bw=0.01,normalize=function(x) x)
```
![sample_sizes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19682548/18840745/9df697d0-83dd-11e6-8aec-2e74aa433501.png)
```R
Your samples were randomly subsampled to 9143 cells
```

<p align="justify">In this case we will continue with the samples without randomly subsampling. From the phenotypic fingerprint, alpha diversity metrics can be calculated. <code>n</code> is the number of technical replicates, <code>d</code> is a rounding factor which is used to eliminate unstable density values from the dataset. Different rounding factors usually only scale the diversity estimates by a fixed factor and do not affect temporal trends or comparative analysis.</p>
```R
### Calculate ecological parameters from normalized fingerprint 
### Densities will be normalized to the interval [0,1]
### n = number of replicates
### d = rounding factor
Diversity.fbasis <- Diversity(fbasis,d=3,n=1,plot=FALSE)
Evenness.fbasis <- Evenness(fbasis,d=3,n=1,plot=FALSE)
Structural.organization.fbasis <- So(fbasis,d=3,n=1,plot=FALSE)
Coef.var.fbasis <- CV(fbasis,d=3,n=1,plot=FALSE)
```

Add the argument `plot=TRUE` in case a quick plot of the D<sub>2</sub> diversity values is desired.

Alpha diversity analysis has completed: time to export all the data to your working directory. If you are not sure where this is, type <code>getwd()</code>.  
```R
### Export ecological data to .csv file in the chosen directory
write.csv2(file="results.metrics.csv",
           cbind(Diversity.fbasis, Evenness.fbasis,
                                          Structural.organization.fbasis,
                 Coef.var.fbasis))
```
Optionally, you can also perform a beta diversity analysis using Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) or PCoA from the <code>vegan</code> package. The <code>beta.div.fcm</code> function does the calculation (accepts all dissimilarity metrics of the <code>vegdist</code> function under the <code>dist</code> argument) and the <code>plot.beta.fcm</code> plots the ordination. Additional factorial arguments to be given to the plot function are: <code>color</code> and <code>shape</code> which can be used for visualization (<code>color</code> and <code>shape</code> have to be factor vectors with length equal to number of samples). The title of the legends for these factors can be specified in the <code>labels</code> argument. In case no legend has to be displayed, <code>legend.pres</code> can be put to <code>FALSE</code>.
<p align="justify"><b> Attention: this dimension reduction utilizes the density values as opposed to the count values which are used for beta-diversity analysis in community 16S data sets</b></p>

```R
### Beta-diversity assessment of fingerprint
beta.div <- beta.div.fcm(fbasis,n=1,ord.type="PCoA")
plot.beta.fcm(beta.div,legend.pres=FALSE)
```

<p align="justify">It is often also useful to know the exact cell densities of your sample. This is performed by the following code. Additionally it quantifies the amount of High Nucleic Acid (HNA) and Low Nucleic Acid (LNA) bacteria as defined by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135413008361">Prest et al. (2013)</a>. Be aware that the <code>filter</code> function has conflicts with the filter function from the <code>dplyr</code> package.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Warning: the HNA/LNA partition is only valid for data gathered on a BD C6 Accuri flow cytometer.
For other flow cytometers the threshold (FL1-H = 20 000) should be adjusted according to the appropriate reference samples.</b></p>
```R
### Creating a rectangle gate for counting HNA and LNA cells
rGate_HNA <- rectangleGate("FL1-H"=c(asinh(20000), 20)/max,"FL3-H"=c(0,20)/max, 
                           filterId = "HNA bacteria")
### Normalize total cell gate
sqrcut1 <- matrix(c(8.75,8.75,14,14,3,7.5,14,3)/max,ncol=2, nrow=4)
colnames(sqrcut1) <- c("FL1-H","FL3-H")
polyGate1 <- polygonGate(.gate=sqrcut1, filterId = "Total Cells")

### Check if rectangle gate is correct, if not, adjust rGate_HNA
xyplot(`FL3-H` ~ `FL1-H`, data=flowData_transformed[1], filter=rGate_HNA,
       scales=list(y=list(limits=c(0,1)),
                   x=list(limits=c(0.4,1))),
       axis = axis.default, nbin=125, par.strip.text=list(col="white", font=2, 
                                                          cex=2), smooth=FALSE)
### Extract the cell counts
a <- filter(flowData_transformed, rGate_HNA) 
HNACount <- summary(a);HNACount <- toTable(HNACount)
s <- filter(flowData_transformed, polyGate1)
TotalCount <- summary(s);TotalCount <- toTable(TotalCount)

### Exporting cell counts to .csv file to working directory
write.csv2(file="results.counts.csv",
           data.frame(Samples=flowData_transformed@phenoData@data$name, 
                      Total.cells = TotalCount$true,HNA.cells = HNACount$true))
```
